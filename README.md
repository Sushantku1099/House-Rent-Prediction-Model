# 🏠 House Rent Prediction Model

Predicting house rent based on property size using Simple Linear Regression with Python.

---

## 📝 Project Overview

This project uses a simple linear regression algorithm to predict monthly house rent based on the size (in sq.ft). Utilizing the popular Scikit-learn library, the model is trained on a dataset of house sizes and corresponding rents, enabling estimation of rent for new property sizes.

## 📊 Dataset

- Features: Size of the house in square feet  
- Target: Rent price in ?/month  
- Data cleaning includes removing commas and converting rents to float values.
